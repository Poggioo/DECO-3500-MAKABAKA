## Introduction

This file is used to guide the use of prototypes.

There are a total of three functions, the first is that the student camera can only be visible to the host and cohost.
The second is for chat question and answer. If a student asks a question, it will give a hint to the teacher. When other students reply, that question will be marked as answered. 
When the teacher confirms that the problem has been answered correctly, the problem will be marked as solved.
The third is real-time video playback, in which students can watch the recording of the current lecture directly, see before content and jump back to live mode, just like youtube live.

In the Iteration1 folder of GitHub Code, there is the function code in iteration1, which is not needed normally. It just upload as part of the project process
